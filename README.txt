React and SASS practice project.

Created as part of the freecodecamp.com curriculum.
Problem statement: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard

the code-in/ folder holds the raw JSX and SCSS, which are processed into the code-out/ folder.

What I found most interesting with this project ws that when seeing other people's leaderboard projects, I'd feel that the "sort" buttons actually sorted the user data, when in reality it's just two different leaderboard, and you toggle between them. The app doesn't need to do any sorting because the API responds with a sorted list, of which you'd only have access to the top 100 anyways.
